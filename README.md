LocationReportEnablerXposed
=====================

A simple android app to enable Google Location Report, Google Now, Google Personal Safety (Emergency sharing), Google maps (photos/reviews) and related functions in China.

This module simply hooks `TelephonyManager` so in theory you can also try it on other apps.

*Xposed REQUIRED*

If you have already installed the xposed framework, you can easily install the below module to enable location report and do not effect any other apps.
